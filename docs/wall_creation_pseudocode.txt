Create Each Cell in Grid

Adding Walls and Neighbors to each cell:

FOR EACH cell in Cell Array: 

	ADD top wall and neighbor
		IF the y position of the cell is 1 (e.g. on the top row) THEN
			CREATE top wall with cell and null entry
			SET top neighbor to NULL
		ELSE
			CREATE top wall with working cell and cell above
			IF wall array contains top wall THEN
				GET index of top wall in wall array
				GET wall from wall array
				SET top wall with wall from wall array
			ELSE
				SET top wall from newly CREATEd wall
			END IF
			SET top neighbor to appropriate cell
		END IF
	END ADD

	ADD right wall and neighbor
		IF the x position of the cell is equal to the max width THEN
			< SEE ABOVE FOR THE TOP WALL >
	END ADD

	ADD bottom wall and neighbor
		IF the y position of the cell is equal to the max height THEN
			< SEE ABOVE FOR THE TOP WALL >
	END ADD

	ADD left wall and neighbor
		IF the x position of the cel is 1 THEN
			< SEE ABOVE FOR THE TOP WALL >


Drawing all walls and avoiding duplicates:

CREATE copy of WALL ARRAY
FOR EACH cell in cell array
	IF wall array CONTAINS top wall THEN
		DRAW top wall				**** SEE BELOW FOR "DRAW" STRATEGY
		REMOVE top wall from wall array
	ELSE
		DO NOTHING
	END IF

	REPEAT THE ABOVE IF STATEMENT FOR EACH WALL
END FOR

Drawing a Wall:

0,0 --------------------------- pixelWidth,0
|					|
|					|
|					|
|					|
0,pixelHeight ----------------- pixelWidth,pixelHeight


The absolute canvas dimensions can be found by taking the x and y positions of the cell, subtracting 1, and multiplying by the pixelHeight and pixelWidth

Determine the absolute coordinates of the top left part of each cell
	canvasX = (cell.getX-1)*pixelWidth
	canvasY = (cell.getY-1)*pixelHeight

Top -> (canvasX,canvasY) to (canvasX+pixelWidth,canvasY)

Right -> (canvasX+pixelWidth,canvasY) to (canvasX+pixelWidth, canvasY+pixelHeight)

Bottom -> (canvasX+pixelWidth, canvasY+pixelHeight) to (canvasX, canvasY+pixelHeight)

Right -> (canvasX, canvasY+pixelHeight) to (canvasX, canvasY)




Wall Equivalency:

Walls are the same if they contain the same pair of cell ends
