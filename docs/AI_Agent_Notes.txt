Environment: Generated Maze -> All cells contain walls and exist as part of the maze.
Goal: Make it to the Goal Cell through the maze


PEAS:

Performance: Can it reach the goal directly as possible
Environment: Generated Maze
Actuators: Moving to next cell
Sensors: determining which wall is a passage


Randomly select a start and end cell

While the current cell is not the goal cell:

0) Start at the start cell

1) Determine which walls are passages
    1.1) For each wall on current cell, check to see if they are passages
        1.1.1) For each cell that is unvisited, compute the distance to the goal for each
        1.1.2) Move to the neighboring cell and add cell to path list
        1.1.3)
    1.2) If all neighboring cells on the path are blocked by walls, go to previous cell and repeat if able
        1.2.1) repeat this as many times as necessary

2) From available choices, determine which cell is closest to the goal cell
    2.1) Compute straight line distances between possible cells and goal cell
    2.2) Move to cell with lowest value

3) Move to next cell, and repeat from (1)
