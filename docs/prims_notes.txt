For pixel resolution:

Total width / Pixel Width = Number of pixels

500 / 10 = 50

0
10
20
30
40


Int x * pixel width = top right corner of rectangle

0 * 10 = 


Prim's Randomized

Three data structures:

(Class) Graph
	Cell <class>
		xCoord <int>
		yCoord <int>
		Cell Above <Cell>		NOTE: if a cell is at an edge of the graph, the value will be 'null'
		Cell Below <Cell>
		Cell Left <Cell>
		Cell Right <Cell>
		Visit Count <int>
	Vertices <List<Cell>>
		
	

Prim's Algorithm

Choose a random cell on the first column and move to path list
For all adjacent cells, add to walls list.
